# About Me

The following project is a [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) Mod Loader mod. It is a physics mod, allowing for characters' physics to be swapped and edited in semi-real time within any of the three games.

# Supported Games

- Sonic Heroes

# Features

- Semi-realtime physics editing and swapping. 
  - SADX/SA2: Re-enter level for changes to take effect.
  - Heroes: Switch leader. 
  - Will consider true realtime editing if it's a requested feature.
- Easy to use, fancy GUI. 

# Usage

- Install mod like a regular Reloaded II mod.
- Run `Config.exe` to setup mod configuration.

Semi-realtime editing is supported (see above).
